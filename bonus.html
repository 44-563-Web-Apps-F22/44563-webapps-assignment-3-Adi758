        is a bear species endemic to China.It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. 
        The name panda is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. 
        Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, 
        with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.</p>
